# Return Current Date and Time

A simple Python module that returns the input string from the function's argument and also shows the current time and date.

The source code uses the `std:chrono` library for computing the current date and time, and then just passes that to a string.

```python
import showdate as c
c.showdate(user) # the program will return user on the screen and the current date and time
```
